> Aldabra, the world's second-largest coral atoll (the largest is Kiritimati), 
> is located east of the continent of Africa. 
> 
> It is part of the Aldabra Group of islands in the Indian Ocean 
> that are part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, 
> with a distance of 1,120 km (700 mi) southwest of the capital, Victoria on Mahé Island. 
> 
> Initially named by Arab seafarers for its harsh environment, 
> Aldabra became a French colony dependency in the 18th century, 
> leading to the exploitation of its natural resources, particularly giant tortoises. 
> 
> After passing through British hands, Aldabra faced potential military use in the 1960s, 
> but international protests resulted in its protection. 
> The atoll boasts unique geography, featuring the world's largest raised coral reef 
> and a large shallow lagoon. 
> 
> Aldabra's history involves human impact, including failed agricultural ventures.
>
> Post-World War II, conservation efforts increased, leading to its inclusion in the British Indian Ocean Territory and eventual independence for Seychelles. Following an international protest by scientists known as the 'Aldabra Affair,' the Royal Society of London and later the Seychelles Islands Foundation conducted research, leading to Aldabra's declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The atoll's flora and fauna, notably the giant tortoises, comprise an 'ecological wonder', with Aldabra serving as a critical breeding ground for various species. Conservation challenges, such as invasive species and plastic pollution, persist, but protective measures, including UNESCO designation, underscore Aldabra's significance as a natural vital scientific research site. Aldabra receives limited tourism to safeguard its delicate ecosystem and is accessible primarily through guided tours.
